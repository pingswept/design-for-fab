### Types of bearings

|        | (radial) | tapered | thrust |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| plain  |          |         |        |
| ball   |          |         |        |
| roller |          |         |        |
| needle |          |         |        |

Plain bearings are also called bushings, journal bearings, or sleeve bearings.

A ball bearing uses spheres; a roller bearing uses cylinders; and a needle bearing uses real skinny cylinders. 

### How ball bearings are made

For a small, cheap ball bearing like those used in skateboard wheels, we start with an outer ring and an inner ring.

We load 7 loose balls between the rings. We would like to fit more, but we can't fit them in.

Then we arrange the balls evenly around the inner ring and weld in a ball cage to keep them spread out.

Finally, we add a shield or seal. Both increase friction, but it can be worth it to keep dust out and grease in.

Side note: for larger, fancier bearings, we can make a small groove in the side of the outer race to allow more balls to be added. Then we weld, grind, and polish that groove away. The added balls let the bearing take high loads with less deformation, which probably leads to longer life.

### Skateboard bearings dimensions
