# Shafts

## Rod vs. shaft

In engineering parlance, a rod means a round stick and a shaft means a **really** round stick.

If you look at [a 6 mm diameter steel rod like McMaster 8920K22](https://www.mcmaster.com/8920K22/), you'll find it costs around $9 per meter, can be undersized up to 0.05 mm, and has no straightness specification.

Compare that to [a 6 mm steel shaft like Mcmaster 1482K64](https://www.mcmaster.com/1482K64/). The shaft costs around $40 per meter, can only be undersized by 0.01 mm, and has a straightness specification of 0.03 mm per 300 mm of length.

Generally, we buy rods unless we need to make something spin. For spinning stuff, we use shafts.

## How to attach stuff to shafts

### 1. Press fit

### 2. Set screws

### 3. D-shafts

### 4. Keys and keyways

### 5. Tapered hubs

### 6. Clamping shaft couplings
