# Materials

When you're in school, you have relatively limited resources. Here are a few families of materials and fabrication methods that you may be able to use.

1. cardboard and foamcore + X-Acto knife and hot glue
2. 3D-printed PLA or TPU, possibly with heat-set inserts
3. laser-cut acrylic, plywood, MDF or chipboard
4. construction lumber + miter saw, band saw, and table saw
5. 80/20 structural aluminum framing + miter saw and drill press
6. sheet metal + tin snips, jump shear, and box brake
7. Aluminum or steel + lathe and mill

Once you get to industry, you have more choices-- LOTS MORE.

## Aluminum

There are at least 530 different aluminum alloys. For only $150, you can buy the ANSI H35.1 standard and read all 12 pages (includes appendix).

Alternatively, here are a few guidelines that will help you get your bearings. (That's almost a pun, but bearings are made of 440C steel, not aluminum.)

| Alloy | Composition               | Most common example |
|:-----:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------:|
| 1xxx  | pure (>99%) aluminum      | 1100                |
| 2xxx  | alloyed with copper       | 2024                |
| 3xxx  | alloyed with manganese    | 3003                |
| 4xxx  | alloyed with silicon      | ???                 |
| 5xxx  | alloyed with magnesium    | 5052                |
| 6xxx  | alloyed with Mg2Si        | 6061                |
| 7xxx  | alloyed with zinc         | 7075                |

* 1100: easy to form, cheap
* 3003: easy to form, cheap, but a little stronger

* 5052: strong, great corrosion resistance, not heat-treatable
* 6061: strong, good corrosion resistance, heat-treatable, machines well

* 2024: very strong, still formable
* 7075: even stronger, less formable, better corrosion resistance

* 7075-T6: the most bad-ass aluminum

Reminder about fatigue: aluminum fatigues; steel doesn't.

## Steel

Steel = iron + carbon (0.04% - 1.5%)

You can read about different steel alloys in the SAE A29 standard, only $56 for 17 pages (almost 4x cheaper than the H35.1 aluminum standard!).

Generally, the last two digits of the alloy designation are the carbon concentration by mass in hundredths of a percent.

| Alloy | Composition                | Example                              |
|:-----:|:--------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|
| 1xxx  | plain carbon steels        | 1010, 1018                           |
| 2xxx  | nickel                     |                                      |
| 3xxx  | nickel-chromium            |                                      |
| 4xxx  | molybdenum                 | 4130 (gears), 4140 (stiffer, harder) |
| 5xxx  | chromium                   | 5160                                 |
| 6xxx  | chromium-vanadium          |                                      |
| 7xxx  | tungsten                   |                                      |
| 8xxx  | nickel-chromium-molybdenum |                                      |
| 9xxx  | silicon-manganese          |                                      |

### Tool steel

| Designator | Description          |
|:----------:|:--------------------:|
|     A2     | Air hardening        |
|     M2     | Machine tool cutters |
|     O1     | Oil hardening        |
|     S2     | Shock resistant      |

Notes on material usage, based on notes taken by Ananya Ram (thanks!)

### Plastics:

* LDPE → milk jug material, cheap
* HDPE → stronger, terrible for the environment, can’t really be machined
* MDPE → recycled material, still terrible for the environment
* Polycarb sheet → like acrylic, but can absorb a lot of energy (high energy toughness)
* Acrylic → can’t machine because it shatters~~
* Delrin → optimized for machining
* Nylon → super strong plastic, some are stronger than steel

### Composites

* Fiberglass → boats, super stiff
* Carbon fiber → also super strong, $$,

### Woods: good for lightweight structures

* Pine → cheapest, lightest, crappiest material
* Cedar → even lighter than pine, eh about everything else. Smells good briefly...
* Fir → Pine 2.0, stiff, tables and long-term stuff
* Mahogany → looks nice, fancy furniture
* Maple → hard, for cutting board
* Red Oak → heavier means stronger, and it’s very strong, good for floors
* Baltic Birch Plywood → plywood = alternating grain
* Purple Heart → one of the densest woods that you can just buy

### Metals, usually alloys:

* Copper → thermally conductive, expensive, not an alloy
* 1018 Steel → crappy steel, still expensive (nice but heavy)
* Stainless Steel 304 → same as mild steel, non-magnetic, doesn’t rust (nice but heavy)
* A2 Tool Steel → air-hardened steel, very uniform, used for knives (nice but heavy)
* 6061 Aluminum → cheapest aluminum engineers use
* 5052 Aluminum → easily formed or welded
* 2024 Aluminum → used for airplanes etc. extra stiff allow
* Brass → copper + zinc(?); mostly used for aesthetic
* Titanium → $84, stiffest material
