# Design for Fabrication syllabus

<section>

ME 93, Design for Fabrication, Section DF-LEC, class number 23803

## Course description

Explore design thinking through a series of practical design challenges, coupled with design review by your peers and the instructor. Over the course of the semester, you will face approximately six challenges that require you, sometimes alone, sometimes as a team, to design, prototype, and fabricate working solutions. Emphasis will be placed on understanding real-world design constraints resulting from different fabrication methods, hardware selection, and material properties. An effort will be made to allow students to pursue areas of personal interest, such as mechanisms, embedded electronics, or robotics, in the context of the design challenges. **Students with scant interest in fabrication are encouraged to enroll in other courses.** The course will have no textbook, but there will be some expenses for materials incurred.

## Course goals

The goal of the course is to force students to gain experience with the practical challenges of building mechanical hardware. Acting as a counterbalance to the largely theory-heavy curriculum of the modern university, the course makes students work in teams with their mostly inexperienced peers, where they argue, break drill bits, and struggle with lightly documented hardware. They face engineering failure and have to recover to succeed.

## Textbooks

There will be no textbook for the class.

## Assignments

Most of the class will be working on 6 design challenges, sometimes in small teams.

## No electronics during lectures

Generally, I need too much of your attention to allow distractions like cell phones and laptops in class. There will be rare exceptions in class, like when we're using computers as tools for designing the stuff we're making. If I have to remind you about this a few times, I'll ask you to leave class. If you think this might be a problem for you, I would recommend putting your phone somewhere inaccessible during class. You should probably also think carefully about the role technology is playing in your life. (I should add that I also feel the tug of the phone, though maybe not as strongly as some of you.)

## Lectures

Tu, Th 10:30-11:45 AM in [](http://campusmaps.tufts.edu/medford/#fid=205), the Science and Engineering Complex, 200 College Avenue, 1st floor, [Room 22, also called "Blake-Perlman Computational Studio" or "that glass room next to the cafe in the SEC."](http://engineering.tufts.edu/computing/facilities/blake)

Project work will take place in Blake, in [Nolop](https://nolop.org/), and in [Bray Lab](https://sites.tufts.edu/bray/).

## Financial constraints

If, for whatever reason, you cannot afford to pay for the stuff needed for this class, please let me know, either in person or via email. In virtually all cases, the Mechanical Engineering Department will pay for whatever you can't afford; if they can't, I will. Under no circumstances should your education suffer because you don't have the right tools or supplies.

## Honesty

I take honesty very seriously. Not only am I required to report violations of academic integrity, I am glad to do so. We are all fortunate to be at Tufts; there is no excuse for squandering that opportunity by representing someone else's work as your own. If you're unsure about the details, read the [Tufts Academic Integrity Policy](https://students.tufts.edu/student-affairs/student-life-policies/academic-integrity-policy).

## Grading

### The problem

A traditional grading scheme, in which you are asked to meet carefully defined requirements and then awarded points in proportion to the number of those requirements you meet successfully, doesn't work well in a class like this for three reasons.

The first is that if I grade you with any static set of requirements, most of you will stop as soon as you meet those requirements, i.e. you will try to do the minimum to get an A. This is because you have been trained to maximize your grades since elementary school.

The second is that, when it comes to fabrication, we have a wide range of experience in this class. Some of you have built lots of stuff; some have you have built very little. This is very different than, say, differential equations, where we have a huge cadre of calculus teachers trying to prepare you for the class. Those of you with experience building stuff will have gained it either at home, or at a summer program, or some extracurricular robotics club. There is no AP Building Stuff exam. If I try to hold you all to the same standard, some of you will be underchallenged, while some of you will be crushed.

The third reason, which is probably the most important, is that in engineering, failure is the immediate precursor of learning. The moment you find yourself thinking, "Hmmm, that's funny, that definitely wasn't what I was expecting," is the moment your learning opportunity arrives. Once we understand that, it is immediately clear that you should not be penalized for failing. Instead, I want you to make predictions, model the behavior of systems, and try to understand how stuff works at a deep level. Explore the boundaries of your knowledge. That's where the learning happens. You can't do that if you're getting punished for every misstep.

### The plan

The best solution I have to this situation is to treat you like responsible adults, who are genuinely interested in learning. For each project that we do, I will ask you to develop a short list of learning goals: basically, what do you want to get out of this project? If you're not exactly sure, I can give you some suggestions. Then, at each prototype milestone and final project submission, we will have a "quiz" on Canvas, in which you attest to the degree to which you met your goals and reflect on your successes and failures. At the end of the semester, your grade will just be the percentage of your goals that you met.

Here are a few effects that this should have.

First, you do not have to worry about getting an A at all. To get an A, just set your goals very low and meet those goals-- easy! Cool, that's out of the way; now you can focus on learning.

Second, I hope you'll find that this learning model can help you transition to how you will learn after you graduate. Continuing to learn and grow as an engineer is absolutely crucial-- if you can't develop as a professional, you've got a real problem on your hands. This course will give you a chance to see what happens when you're the one deciding what you're trying to learn and how to go about doing it. My hope is that as you set learning goals and try meeting them, you get some insight into what works well or not so well for you. You are, of course, welcome to try different strategies during the semester.

One warning: you may think to yourself, "Sweet! This class is going to be so easy! I'll just set my goals to be learning virtually nothing, and then succeed at that! Graduation, here I come!" If you take a disciplined approach, that might work, but the far more likely outcome is that the class will be engaging to you, and you will spend a bunch of time learning stuff, despite your best efforts. If you just want a reliably easy course, take something predictable with a traditional grading structure, where there is no danger of your natural enthusiasm for learning fouling everything up.

### Learning goal examples

Your learning goals should be personalized to your experience, situation, and interests. They should be achievable given a level of effort you think you can muster. They should be customized to the project.

Here are some example goals.

*   Use the laser cutter (which I have never used before).
*   Use the laser cutter to cut gears (which I have never designed before).
*   Use the waterjet to cut at least one metal gear (which I have never done before).
*   Get more comfortable with cordless drills and at least one other hand tool.
*   Test my system to failure, then rebuild it stronger.
*   Complete my project 24 hours early.
*   Model, predict and subsequently measure at least one mechanical property of my project.
*   Complete the project in less than 6 hours of focused effort.
*   Make at least one part out of steel.
*   Turn a part on a lathe at Bray.
*   Estimate the power requirements of the project ahead of time, and then measure them afterwards.
*   Spend at least 1/3 of my effort on the aesthetics of the project.
*   Make my most refined 3D print ever.

## Budget

The Department of Mechanical Engineering will cover up to $NNN per student for project expenses.

## Project storage

During the semester, you will be allocated a storage shelf in Bray, Nolop, or Blake where you can keep your projects and related materials. After the semester ends, either you can take your device back to your dorm room, or I will lovingly place it in the dumpster for you on May 1st (the first day of finals).

## Materials and other resources available

In addition to your project budget, we will have prototyping materials available for you to use. These will include foamcore, cardboard, lots of pink and blue foam, acrylic and aluminum. Most of this will be available in Bray or Nolop.

For those of you thinking about an electromechanical solutions, I have a large collection of microcontrollers and sensors used for my electronics class; I'm happy to share that stuff as well.

We are also well-connected in the larger ecosystem of Boston makerspaces; if Tufts doesn't have something you need, we can probably get you access to a space that has what you need.

## A note about general resourcefulness

Engineering is hard, and you are adults. It is fairly easy to get discouraged and think that this class is too overwhelming or unstructured. It is both of those things, but the answer is to be resourceful and resilient in the face of that adversity.

You have a great opportunity before you, in which you can try building stuff the world has never seen. You can also probably skate by without really putting your heart into it. You will get out of this class roughly what you put into it; I strongly recommend trying harder than usual.
