---------------------------------------------------------
HEY, YOU FOUND THE OLD PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS FROM 2020!
THESE ARE NOT THE SAME AS WHAT WE WILL DO IN 2022!
We might repeat a couple, but don't rely on that for any major life decisions.
---------------------------------------------------------

<h1>P6: New world, new problems</h1>
<p>The requirements for prosperous life on our planet have changed with the arrival of COVID-19. One of our responsibilities as engineers is to identify and explore emergent problem spaces. With COVID-19, some of the new problems are obvious-- we need more masks that can filter out virus particles and ventilators that can help the sick breathe. Some of the new problems are less obvious, relating to longer term changes to our behavior as a society. For example, shared transportation (cars, buses, trains) may change dramatically.</p>
<p>Design a mechanical or electro-mechanical system with the following characteristics:</p>
<ol>
    <li>it addresses a new problem brought on by COVID-19, and</li>
    <li>it can plausibly be fabricated and sold in the likely economic climate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of our usual process of prototyping and iterative fabrication, we'll have slightly different milestones; the deadlines are listed at the bottom.</p>
<p>For the first stage, you should generate no fewer than 20 ideas. "What, 20 ideas! That's madness!" you yell at the ceiling. But no, it is important. When you generate surplus ideas, you force yourselves to go beyond your initial conception of the problem space. Some of the ideas will be useless, but a useless idea can often lead the way to a fruitful one. Please post your list of 20 ideas as a numbered list on the <a href="https://nolop.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=inventive-design">#inventive-design</a> Slack channel. Each idea should have as short a description as possible while still being comprehensible. Once the ideas are posted, please give 6 of your peers feedback in the comments.</p>
<p>For the second stage, narrow down to one idea that you would like to pursue. You do not have to post anything or notify anyone about your selection, but you should really decide, or you won't have time for the next stage.</p>
<p>For the third stage, post on the <a href="https://nolop.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=inventive-design">#inventive-design</a> Slack channel a list of 3-5 design requirements for your device. They should generally be quantifiable metrics, though normative characteristics (like, "the machine should be bright colored") are okay for non-quantifiable features. Let me add that this might <i>seem</i> like a bunch of malarkey, it is repeatedly the case that omitted or erroneous design requirements are the eternal nemesis of new designs. Like, that's nice that you want to make a mask to filter out viruses-- how fine does your filter need to be so you're not just trying to stop water with a net? There can be no magic solutions here.</p>
<p>The fourth stage is conventional: make a CAD model and post it to the <a href="https://nolop.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=inventive-design">#inventive-design</a> Slack channel. Once the ideas are posted, please give 6 of your peers feedback in the comments.</p>
<p>The last stage is mostly conventional: revise your CAD model, repost, and please give feedback to your peers. As part of your final design, please estimate the cost of fabrication of your device.</p>
<h3>Milestones</h3>
<p>P6 twenty ideas: Tuesday, April 7, by noon.</p>
<p>P6 one idea: Thursday, April 9, by noon.</p>
<p>P6 requirements: Tuesday, April 14, by noon.</p>
<p>P6 design review: Thursday, April 16, by noon.</p>
<p>P6 final design: Thursday, April 23, by noon.</p>
<h1>P5: Element of a 22-piece kinetic art installation</h1>
<p>Build a 11" x 16" panel that has the following characteristics:</p>
<ol>
    <li>it is largely translucent,</li>
    <li>it has a timing sprocket in the lower left corner that, when slowly rotated with a torque of less than 10 oz-in, makes its appearance change through purely mechanical means,</li>
    <li>it has no words, logos, or other explicit messages, and</li>
    <li>it is generally respectful of the workspace around it, i.e. no irritating bells or oozing liquids.</li> 
</ol>
<p>The panels, if you assent, will be installed in the 11" x 16" panes of the windows of the Nolop red zone that face the SEC patio. Each panel will be driven by a stepper motor. The motors will slowly rotate, turning on at dusk and turning off at midnight. Passersby will be entranced by the luminous wonder you have created.</p>
<h3>You will be given:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 GT2 timing belt pulley with a 5 mm bore</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coupling-Support-Hardness-Fittings-Connector/dp/B07L1FMBBC/">1 flange coupler with a 5 mm bore</a></li>
    <li>as much 5 mm stainless steel rod as you need, within reason</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact dimensions and more subtle mechanical details will be more thoroughly specified by Tuesday, March 10.</p>
<p>P5 design review: Tuesday, March 10, at the start of class.</p>
<p>P5 proto: Tuesday, March 24, at the start of class.</p>
<p>P5 final: Tuesday, March 31, at the start of class.</p>
<h1>P4: Gravity-powered record player</h1>
<p>With your partner, build a gravity-powered record player. It should be able to play a 7" diameter record for 4.5 minutes at 45 RPM. If you decide you need a horn to amplify the sound, <b>do not 3D print one</b>. Instead, use folded sheet metal, cardboard, or the like. You might make a trigger mechanism that would start the record playing.</p>
<h3>You will be given:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 vinyl record</li>
    <li>4 or 5 steel needles</li>
    <li>As many bricks as you request, within reason</li>
</ul>
<p>P4 design calculations: Thursday, February 13, at the start of class.</p>
<p>P4 design review: Tuesday, February 18, at the start of class.</p>
<p>P4 proto: Tuesday, February 25, at the start of class. The record should spin under gravity power by this date.</p>
<p>P4 final: Tuesday, March 3, at the start of class.</p>
<h1>P3: Folded mask or costume</h1>
<p>Make a 3D folded mask or costume. It need not be laser-cut, but you must make a CAD model that shows the mask or costume in its folded and unfolded states. It should not be traced from an existing design of picture (unless you also drew the picture). It can cover just your face, or your whole head, but it should be 3 dimensional. It can be made of anything that folds: chipboard, thick paper, thin sheet metal, or anything else you can get. Ancillary decorations, like mustaches, are okay, but the core of the mask should be folded. It should be secured to your head somehow, so you can actually wear it.</p>
    <p>One more requirement: <b>You must make (and retain or document) three prototypes.</b>
<p>You will be given: nothing, but if you want thin aluminum sheet, we can get it by Friday.</p>
<p>Project due: Tuesday, February 11, at the start of class. Please email me a screenshot of your CAD model in folded and unfolded states by that time.</p>
<h1>P2: Hidden mechanism box for kids</h1>
<p>Make a mechanism in a box that connects two opposing rods and survives exploration by kids. It should have the properties listed below.</p>
<ul>
    <li>When you push rod A into the box, rod B moves into the box in a symmetrical fashion. When you pull A out, B emerges too.</li>
    <li>Rods A and B cannot be removed</li>
    <li>The top and sides of the box are opaque, hiding the mechanism. The top should not have fasteners if those fasteners would reveal the nature of the mechanism.</li>
    <li>The bottom is transparent, or in some way reveals the nature of the mechanism.</li>
    <li>The mechanism should be durable when exposed to kids.</li>
    <li>The mechanism should have a satisfying feel-- this might mean detents, no rattling, or smooth motion, but it depends on the mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be given: 2 maple dowels, 3/8" in diameter and 8" long.</p>
<p>Prototype due: Tuesday, January 28, at the start of class. The prototype should test the mechanism, but need not be sealed up.</p>
<p>Project due: Tuesday, February 4, at the start of class.</p>

<h1>P1: Build a trigger mechanism</h1>
<p>Make a trigger mechanism that can reliably hold and release a 9.8 N force (the weight of a 1 kg mass on Earth).</p>
<h3>You will be given:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 ball bearing, 22 mm OD, 8 mm ID, part number 608RS</li>
    <li>2 socket head cap screws, M8 x 1.25 mm, 25 mm length</li>
    <li>2 M8 x 1.25 mm nuts with nylon inserts</li>
    <li>1 rubber band, size 64</li>
    <li>2 socket head cap screws, M3 x 0.5 mm, 8mm length</li>
    <li>1 plastic ball, 0.5" in diameter</li>
    <li>2 M3 x 0.5 mm brass heat-set inserts (in orange cabinet in Nolop)</li>
    <li>(if you want) washers that fit M8 bolts (in gray cabinets in Nolop)</li>
</ul>
