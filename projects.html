<h1>P2: Hidden mechanism box for kids</h1>
<p>Make a mechanism in a box that connects two opposing rods and survives exploration by kids. It should have the properties listed below.</p>
<ul>
    <li>When you push rod A into the box, rod B moves into the box in a symmetrical fashion. When you pull A out, B emerges too.</li>
    <li>Rods A and B cannot be removed</li>
    <li>The top and sides of the box are opaque, hiding the mechanism. The top should not have fasteners if those fasteners would reveal the nature of the mechanism.</li>
    <li>The bottom is transparent, or in some way reveals the nature of the mechanism.</li>
    <li>The mechanism should be durable when exposed to kids.</li>
    <li>The mechanism should have a satisfying feel-- this might mean detents, no rattling, or smooth motion, but it depends on the mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be given: 2 maple dowels, 3/8" in diameter and 8" long.</p>
<p>Design review: Thursday, January 23, in class</p>
<p>Prototype due: Tuesday, January 28, at the start of class. The prototype should test the mechanism, but need not be sealed up.</p>

<h1>P1: Build a trigger mechanism</h1>
<p>Make a trigger mechanism that can reliably hold and release a 9.8 N force (the weight of a 1 kg mass on Earth).</p>
<h3>You will be given:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 ball bearing, 22 mm OD, 8 mm ID, part number 608RS</li>
    <li>2 socket head cap screws, M8 x 1.25 mm, 25 mm length</li>
    <li>2 M8 x 1.25 mm nuts with nylon inserts</li>
    <li>1 rubber band, size 64</li>
    <li>2 socket head cap screws, M3 x 0.5 mm, 8mm length</li>
    <li>1 plastic ball, 0.5" in diameter</li>
    <li>2 M3 x 0.5 mm brass heat-set inserts (in orange cabinet in Nolop)</li>
    <li>(if you want) washers that fit M8 bolts (in gray cabinets in Nolop)</li>
</ul>
