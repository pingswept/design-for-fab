<h1>P5: Element of a 22-piece kinetic art installation</h1>
<p>Build a 10.5" x 17" panel that has three main characteristics:</p>
<ol>
    <li>it is largely translucent,</li>
    <li>it has a timing sprocket in the lower left corner that, when slowly rotated with a torque of less than 10 oz-in, makes its appearance change, and</li>
    <li>it has no words, logos, or other explicit messages.</li>
</ol>
<p>The panels, if you assent, will be installed in the 10.5" x 17" panes of the windows of the Nolop red zone that face the SEC patio. Each panel will be driven by a stepper motor. The motors will slowly rotate, turning on at dusk and turning off at midnight. Passersby will be entranced by the luminous wonder you have created.</p>
<h3>You will be given:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 GT2 timing belt pulley with a 5 mm bore</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coupling-Support-Hardness-Fittings-Connector/dp/B07L1FMBBC/">1 flange coupler with a 5 mm bore</a></li>
    <li>as much 5 mm stainless steel rod as you need, within reason</li>
</ul>
<p>P5 design review: Tuesday, March 10, at the start of class.</p>
<p>P5 proto: Tuesday, March 24, at the start of class.</p>
<p>P5 final: Tuesday, March 31, at the start of class.</p>

<h1>P4: Gravity-powered record player</h1>
<p>With your partner, build a gravity-powered record player. It should be able to play a 7" diameter record for 4.5 minutes at 45 RPM. If you decide you need a horn to amplify the sound, <b>do not 3D print one</b>. Instead, use folded sheet metal, cardboard, or the like. You might make a trigger mechanism that would start the record playing.</p>
<h3>You will be given:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 vinyl record</li>
    <li>4 or 5 steel needles</li>
    <li>As many bricks as you request, within reason</li>
</ul>
<p>P4 design calculations: Thursday, February 13, at the start of class.</p>
<p>P4 design review: Tuesday, February 18, at the start of class.</p>
<p>P4 proto: Tuesday, February 25, at the start of class. The record should spin under gravity power by this date.</p>
<p>P4 final: Tuesday, March 3, at the start of class.</p>
<h1>P3: Folded mask or costume</h1>
<p>Make a 3D folded mask or costume. It need not be laser-cut, but you must make a CAD model that shows the mask or costume in its folded and unfolded states. It should not be traced from an existing design of picture (unless you also drew the picture). It can cover just your face, or your whole head, but it should be 3 dimensional. It can be made of anything that folds: chipboard, thick paper, thin sheet metal, or anything else you can get. Ancillary decorations, like mustaches, are okay, but the core of the mask should be folded. It should be secured to your head somehow, so you can actually wear it.</p>
    <p>One more requirement: <b>You must make (and retain or document) three prototypes.</b>
<p>You will be given: nothing, but if you want thin aluminum sheet, we can get it by Friday.</p>
<p>Project due: Tuesday, February 11, at the start of class. Please email me a screenshot of your CAD model in folded and unfolded states by that time.</p>
<h1>P2: Hidden mechanism box for kids</h1>
<p>Make a mechanism in a box that connects two opposing rods and survives exploration by kids. It should have the properties listed below.</p>
<ul>
    <li>When you push rod A into the box, rod B moves into the box in a symmetrical fashion. When you pull A out, B emerges too.</li>
    <li>Rods A and B cannot be removed</li>
    <li>The top and sides of the box are opaque, hiding the mechanism. The top should not have fasteners if those fasteners would reveal the nature of the mechanism.</li>
    <li>The bottom is transparent, or in some way reveals the nature of the mechanism.</li>
    <li>The mechanism should be durable when exposed to kids.</li>
    <li>The mechanism should have a satisfying feel-- this might mean detents, no rattling, or smooth motion, but it depends on the mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be given: 2 maple dowels, 3/8" in diameter and 8" long.</p>
<p>Prototype due: Tuesday, January 28, at the start of class. The prototype should test the mechanism, but need not be sealed up.</p>
<p>Project due: Tuesday, February 4, at the start of class.</p>
<h1>P1: Build a trigger mechanism</h1>
<p>Make a trigger mechanism that can reliably hold and release a 9.8 N force (the weight of a 1 kg mass on Earth).</p>
<h3>You will be given:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 ball bearing, 22 mm OD, 8 mm ID, part number 608RS</li>
    <li>2 socket head cap screws, M8 x 1.25 mm, 25 mm length</li>
    <li>2 M8 x 1.25 mm nuts with nylon inserts</li>
    <li>1 rubber band, size 64</li>
    <li>2 socket head cap screws, M3 x 0.5 mm, 8mm length</li>
    <li>1 plastic ball, 0.5" in diameter</li>
    <li>2 M3 x 0.5 mm brass heat-set inserts (in orange cabinet in Nolop)</li>
    <li>(if you want) washers that fit M8 bolts (in gray cabinets in Nolop)</li>
</ul>
