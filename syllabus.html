    <h1>Design for Fabrication syllabus</h1>
    <section>
    <p>ME 93, Design for Fabrication, Section DF-LEC, class number 23803</p>
    <h2>Course description</h2>
    <p>Explore design thinking through a series of practical design challenges, coupled with design review by your peers and the instructor. Over the course of the semester, you will face approximately six challenges that require you, sometimes alone, sometimes as a team, to design, prototype, and fabricate working solutions. Emphasis will be placed on understanding real-world design constraints resulting from different fabrication methods, hardware selection, and material properties. An effort will be made to allow students to pursue areas of personal interest, such as mechanisms, embedded electronics, or robotics, in the context of the design challenges. <b>Students with scant interest in fabrication are encouraged to enroll in other courses.</b> The course will have no textbook, but there will be some expenses for materials incurred.</p>
    <h2>Course goals</h2>
    <p>The goal of the course is to force students to gain experience with the practical challenges of building mechanical hardware. Acting as a counterbalance to the largely theory-heavy curriculum of the modern university, the course makes students work in teams with their mostly inexperienced peers, where they argue, break drill bits, and struggle with lightly documented hardware. They face engineering failure and have to recover to succeed.</p>
    <h2>Lecturer</h2>
    <p>Brandon Stafford, brandon.stafford@tufts.edu</p>
    <p>I check email in the morning.</p>
    <h2>Course assistant, sort of</h2>
    <p>???</p>
    <h2>Office hours</h2>
    <p>Brandon's office hours are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tuesdays and Thursdays, noon - 1 PM in Nolop, AKA after class.</li>
        <li>any time we agree on by email</li>
        <li>most afternoons, 3-5 PM in Nolop</li>
    </ul>
    <p>???'s office hours are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mondays and Wednesdays, 4:30-10:30 PM in Nolop</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Textbooks</h2>
    <p>There will be no textbook for the class.</p>
    <h2>Assignments</h2>
    <p>Most of the class will be working on 6 design challenges, sometimes in small teams.</p>
    <h2>No electronics during lectures</h2>
    <p>Generally, I need too much of your attention to allow distractions like cell phones and laptops in class. There will be rare exceptions in class, like when we're using computers as tools for designing the stuff we're making. If I have to remind you about this a few times, I'll ask you to leave class. If you think this might be a problem for you, I would recommend putting your phone somewhere inaccessible during class. You should probably also think carefully about the role technology is playing in your life. (I should add that I also feel the tug of the phone, though maybe not as strongly as some of you.)</p>
    <h2>Lectures</h2>
    <p>Tu, Th 10:30-11:45 AM in <a href="http://campusmaps.tufts.edu/medford/#fid=205"></a>, the Science and Engineering Complex, 200 College Avenue, 1st floor, <a href="http://engineering.tufts.edu/computing/facilities/blake">Room 22, also called "Blake-Perlman Computational Studio" or "that glass room next to the cafe in the SEC."</a></p>
    <p>Project work will take place in Blake, in <a href="https://nolop.org/">Nolop</a>, and in <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/bray/">Bray Lab</a>.</p>
    <h2>Financial constraints</h2>
    <p>If, for whatever reason, you cannot afford to pay for the stuff needed for this class, please let me know, either in person or via email. In virtually all cases, the Mechanical Engineering Department will pay for whatever you can't afford; if they can't, I will. Under no circumstances should your education suffer because you don't have the right tools or supplies.</p>
    <h2>Honesty</h2>
    <p>I take honesty very seriously. Not only am I required to report violations of academic integrity, I am glad to do so. We are all fortunate to be at Tufts; there is no excuse for squandering that opportunity by representing someone else's work as your own. If you're unsure about the details, read the <a href="https://students.tufts.edu/student-affairs/student-life-policies/academic-integrity-policy">Tufts Academic Integrity Policy</a>.</p>
        
    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>Each design challenge will be worth 12 points per week. (So a milestone 2 weeks in duration is worth twice as much as a milestone 1 week in duration.) For each day (or fraction thereof) a project milestone is late, you will lose 1 point (before scaling), so a milestone that is 12 days late is worth 0 points. To receive credit for a milestone, your work must also meet the milestone requirements, which are published at the start of the milestone, or possibly earlier. For example, if a milestone requires creation of a proof of concept, and you don't make one, you lose credit, roughly in proportion to the fraction of the requirements unsatisfied. For group projects with N people per group, you should do roughly 1/N of the work.</p>
    <p>If you complete all the milestones on time within the requirements, or at least 95% of that, you have earned an A. If you hit around 85%, that's a B. You can calculate the details if you want, but the main message is that you should complete all the milestones, and you should do them on time.</p>
    <p>On the one hand, this sounds kind of tough. On the other hand, if you actually like building stuff, you will do fine. We have a  wide spectrum of experience in this class, and people choose projects with differing levels of difficulty. Note that the project requirements do not include any kind of performance target (like, "make a robot that can run faster than 18 mph"), but rather broad categorical requirements, like "You must make a proof-of-concept prototype." In this example, I do care whether you made a legitimate attempt to build a proof of concept; it may well be that your concept fails, because that's based largely on your level of experience relative to what you're attempting to build. My goal is to get you to try to build ambitious projects in a few broad categories, not cross some arbitrary threshold that would be easy for some of you and intensely difficult for others.</p>
    <h2>Budget</h2>
    <p>The Department of Mechanical Engineering will cover up to $100 per student for project expenses.</p>
    <h2>Project storage</h2>
    <p>During the semester, you will be allocated a storage shelf in Bray, Nolop, or Blake where you can keep your projects and related materials. After the semester ends, either you can take your device back to your dorm room, or I will lovingly place it in the dumpster for you on May 1st (the first day of finals).</p>
    <h2>Materials and other resources available</h2>
    <p>In addition to your project budget, we will have prototyping materials available for you to use. These will include foamcore, cardboard, lots of pink and blue foam, acrylic and aluminum. Most of this will be available in Bray or Nolop.</p>
    <p>We also have the potential to get fancy materials or hardware from a few vendors that have a long-term interest in befriending Tufts students. In particular, <a href="https://www.igus.com/">Igus</a>, which makes high-end linear bearings and other cool hardware for robotics, is interested in supporting your projects. There are sample kits of their stuff in Bray; James Aronson, who works in the shop, can tell you all about it.</p>
    <p>For those of you thinking about an electromechanical solutions, I have a large collection of microcontrollers and sensors used for my electronics class; I'm happy to share that stuff as well.</p>
    <p>We are also well-connected in the larger ecosystem of Boston makerspaces; if Tufts doesn't have something you need, we can probably get you access to a space that has what you need.</p>
    <h2>A note about general resourcefulness</h2>
    <p>Engineering is hard, and you are adults. It is fairly easy to get discouraged and think that this class is too overwhelming or unstructured. It is both of those things, but the answer is to be resourceful and resilient in the face of that adversity.</p>
    <p>You have a great opportunity before you, in which you can try building stuff the world has never seen. You can also probably skate by without really putting your heart into it. You will get out of this class roughly what you put into it; I strongly recommend trying harder than usual.</p>
