# ME 93: Design for Fabrication

_Design for Fabrication_ is an engineering design class first taught by Brandon Stafford in the spring of 2020 at Tufts University, now returning for spring 2022.

The point of the class is to provide you with hands-on experience in engineering fabrication.

## Basic information

*   The [syllabus](syllabus.html) for the class
*   [Project requirements](projects.html)
*   Thoughts on [prototyping](prototyping.html)
